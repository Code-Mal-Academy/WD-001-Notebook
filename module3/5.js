//* Sets

const set = new Set([1, 2, 4, 8])

//! Difference between Sets, and Array is Set Doesn't Allow Duplicate Value

//* Maps

const map = new Map([
    ["apple", 500],
    ["bananas", 300],
    ["oranges", 200],
])


//! Difference between Maps, and Object is 
//! A Map remembers the original insertion order of the keys.
//! This Allow For Optimization When There is a lot of insertion, and delete
