# Git Setup

1. If you are in MAC, you don’t need to set up anything. However, for Old Macbooks, you need to install git. Here is the download link to install git: https://www.git-scm.com/downloads

2. This One is Optional. Windows doesn’t have a nice CLI experience with Command Prompt. So, I suggest you install a new Terminal from the Internet. I recommend this one: https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?hl=en-us&gl=us

3. And, you need to open a github account. That’s where we primarily stored our codebases, and assignments: https://github.com/

4. And, connect your git with github:
   ```
   git config --global user.name “Your Name”
   git config --global user.email “Your Email”
   ```

# Git Basic

1. Create a Repository In GitHub ( Private, or Public )

2. Copy the Clone Commands

3. Go To The Folder which you want to clone to. ( I suggest Desktop Location )

4. Open The Terminals, and enter the commands from the repository. ( Git Clone )

5. Open The Folder in VsCode.

6. Write the file, and code you want to add in that folder

7. And, now push that to github:
   `    git add --all
    git commit -m “Your Message”
    git push -u origin main
   `
   Caution: Make Sure you are at the right location while you are in Terminal. Window have location problems if you set up OneDrive

# GitHub Classroom

This is the place where you are going to submit assignments.

1. Open The Link I Gave You, and choose your correct github name

2. Now, you should see the assignments.

3. Click On Module 1 Assignments

4. Clone That Assignments, Do The Assignments, and push using the step 7 that I showed in Git Basic Section
