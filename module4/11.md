# Functional (vs) Object Oriented Programming

In **Functional Programming**, everything you are going to use is going to be Function. And, previously, we have learnt Functional Programming.

In **Object Oriented Programming**, the everything you use is represented by an Object, When you want t o change something, you mutate or call methods from object

You can choose whatever you want, but OOP is necessary because some package, tools in javascript are highly dependant on OOP ( NestJS, Prisma )

OOP is also highly used in Large Companies, and Game Development.
